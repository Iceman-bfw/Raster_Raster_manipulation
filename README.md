# Raster_Raster_manipulation
This is where my python code will live that does simple raster manipulation for testing out the gravipromod model

Search and destry code will make the 3 raster files coresponding to the 3 avalanche classes the gravipromod needs. 
Input for this code will be a raster with the information if each cell is class 1, 2 or 3.
