# Raster_Raster_manipulation
This is where my python code will live that does simple raster manipulation for testing out the gravipromod model

Search and destroy is a raster find and replace function
Split_release_class.py  to run: (python split_release_class.py "TEST_DHM.asc")
this will take a raster with many release classes and split them into .asc files with one release zone in each file. This is the format that Gravipro needs.

fonnbu_slope_3rd_deg is where simple examples are made using a 3rd degree poly based off the sphape of the mtn in Stryn, Norway around the Fonnbu cabin.

Gravi_read_AscHeader.py is a function that reads raster header files.

third_deg_poly.ipynb makes simulated raster data that could avalanche.
